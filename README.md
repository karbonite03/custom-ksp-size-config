# custom-ksp-size-config
A small project that I make to modify the structure of Kerbol System to be larger and more challenging. Requires OPM, Sigma Dimensions, and KSP 1.12+
Remember that I don't own any of these configs, as I was just making a small modification to Kerbol System in general for my private uses. Credits to the original developers
